Tic-Tac-Toe Game (JavaScript, HTML, CSS)

This is a simple web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The game allows two players to take turns playing as "X" and "O" on a 3x3 grid. The objective is to get three of the same symbol in a row, column, or diagonal, following traditional Tic-Tac-Toe rules.

Features:
1. Dynamic Gameplay: Players alternate turns, and the current player is displayed on the screen.
2. Win/Tie Detection: The game checks for winning conditions after each turn, highlighting the winning combination. If all cells are filled without a winner, the game declares a tie.
3. Interactive UI: Once a box is clicked, it becomes unclickable for the rest of the game, ensuring fair gameplay.
4. Reset Functionality: After a game concludes, a "New Game" button allows players to reset the board and start again.
5. This project demonstrates the use of basic DOM manipulation, event handling, and conditional logic in JavaScript. It is a fun, interactive way to practice web development skills, particularly in front-end development.
